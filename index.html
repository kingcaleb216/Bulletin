            <p>Alas And did my Savior bleed<br>
            And did my Sovereign die<br>
            Would He devote that sacred head<br>
            For sinners such as I</p>

            <b><p>At the cross at the cross<br>

            And now I am happy all the day</p></b>

            <p>Was it for crimes that I had done<br>
            He groaned upon the tree<br>
            Amazing pity Grace unknown<br>
            And love beyond degree</p>

            <b><p>At the cross at the cross<br>

            And now I am happy all the day</p></b>

            <p>Well might the sun in darkness hide<br>
            And shut his glories in<br>
            When Christ the mighty Maker died<br>
            For man the creature's sin</p>

            And now I am happy all the day</p></b>

            <p>Thus might I hide my blushing face<br>
            While Calvary's cross appears<br>
            Dissolve my heart in thankfulness<br>
            And melt mine eyes to tears</p>

            And now I am happy all the day</p></b>

            <p>But drops of grief can ne'er repay<br>
            The debt of love I owe<br>
            Here Lord I give myself away<br>
            'Tis all that I can do</p>
