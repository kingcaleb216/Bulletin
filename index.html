            <p><b>1</b> As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.</p>

            <p><b>2</b> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?b</p>

            <p><b>3</b> My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, “Where is your God?”</p>

            <p><b>4</b> These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.</p>

            <p><b>5</b> Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation</p>

            <p><b>6</b> and my God. My soul is cast down within me; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.</p>

            <p><b>7</b> Deep calls to deep at the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your waves have gone over me.</p>

            <p><b>8</b> By day the LORD commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.</p>

            <p><b>9</b> I say to God, my rock: “Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”</p>

            <p><b>10</b> As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, “Where is your God?”</p>

            <p><b>11</b> Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.</p>

            <p><b>3</b> Send out your light and your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling!</p>

            <p><b>4</b> Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, and I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God.</p>
