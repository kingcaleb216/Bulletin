                <p>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!<br>
                Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!<br>
                Heir of salvation, purchase of God<br>
                Born of his Spirit, washed in His blood</p>

                <p>This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long<br>
                This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long</p>

                <p>Perfect submission, perfect delight<br>
                Visions of rapture now burst on my sight<br>
                Angels descending bring from above<br>
                Echoes of mercy, whispers of love</p>

                <p>This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long<br>
                This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long</p>

                <p>I love to tell the story<br>
                Of unseen things above,<br>
                Of Jesus and His glory,<br>
                Of Jesus and His love.</p>

                <p>I love to tell the story,<br>
                Because I know ’tis true;<br>
                It satisfies my longings<br>
                As nothing else can do.</p>
                I love to tell the story,<br>
                ’Twill be my theme in glory<br>
                To tell the old, old story<br>
                of Jesus and His love.</p>

                <p>I love to tell the story;<br>
                More wonderful it seems<br>
                Than all the golden fancies<br>
                Of all my golden dreams,<br>
                I love to tell the story,<br>
                It did so much for me;<br>
                And that is just the reason
                I tell it now to thee.</p>

                <p>I love to tell the story;<br>
                ’Tis pleasant to repeat<br>
                What seems each time I tell it,<br>
                More wonderfully sweet.<br>
                I love to tell the story;<br>
                For some have never heard<br>
                The message of salvation<br>
                From God’s own holy Word.</p>

                <p>I love to tell the story;<br>
                For those who know it best<br>
                Seem hungering and thirsting<br>
                To hear it like the rest.<br>
                And when, in scenes of glory,<br>
                I sing the new, new song,<br>
                ’Twill be the old, old story,<br>
                That I have loved so long</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>On Jordan's stormy banks I stand<br>
                and cast a wishful eye<br>
                to Canaan's fair and happy land<br>
                where my possessions lie</p>

                <p>I am bound for the promised land<br>
                I am bound for the promised land<br>
                Oh who will come and go with me<br>
                I am bound for the promised land</p>

                <p>O'er all those wide extended plains<br>
                shines one eternal day<br>
                there God the Son forever reigns<br>
                and scatters night away</p>

                <p>I am bound for the promised land<br>
                I am bound for the promised land<br>
                Oh who will come and go with me<br>
                I am bound for the promised land</p>

                <p>No chilling winds or poisonous breath<br>
                can reach that healthful shore<br>
                sickness and sorrow pain and death<br>
                are felt and feared no more</p>

                <p>I am bound for the promised land<br>
                I am bound for the promised land<br>
                Oh who will come and go with me<br>
                I am bound for the promised land</p>

                <p>When I shall reach that happy place<br>
                I'll be forever blest<br>
                for I shall see my Father's face<br>
                and in his bosom rest</p>
