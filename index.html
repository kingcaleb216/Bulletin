                <p>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine<br>
                Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine<br>
                Heir of salvation, purchase of God<br>
                Born of his Spirit, washed in His blood</p>

                <p>This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long<br>
                This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long</p>

                <p>Perfect submission, perfect delight<br>
                Visions of rapture now burst on my sight<br>
                Angels descending bring from above<br>
                Echoes of mercy, whispers of love</p>

                <p>This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long<br>
                This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long</p>

                <p>Perfect submission, all is at rest<br>
                I in my Savior am happy and blessed<br>
                Watching and waiting, looking above<br>
                Filled with his goodness, lost in his love</p>

                <p>This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long<br>
                This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long</p>

                <p>I love to tell the story<br>
                ’Tis pleasant to repeat<br>
                What seems each time I tell it<br>
                More wonderfully sweet<br>
                I love to tell the story<br>
                For some have never heard<br>
                The message of salvation<br>
                From God’s own holy Word</p>

                <p>I love to tell the story<br>

                For those who know it best<br>
                Seem hungering and thirsting<br>
                To hear it like the rest<br>
                And when, in scenes of glory<br>
                I sing the new, new song<br>
                ’Twill be the old, old story<br>
                That I have loved so long</p>

                <p>I love to tell the story<br>
