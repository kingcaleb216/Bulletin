                <p>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine<br>
                Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine<br>
                Heir of salvation, purchase of God<br>
                Born of his Spirit, washed in His blood</p>

                <p>This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long<br>
                This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long</p>

                <p>Perfect submission, perfect delight<br>
                Visions of rapture now burst on my sight<br>
                Angels descending bring from above<br>
                Echoes of mercy, whispers of love</p>

                <p>This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long<br>
                This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long</p>

                <p>Perfect submission, all is at rest<br>
                I in my Savior am happy and blessed<br>
                Watching and waiting, looking above<br>
                Filled with his goodness, lost in his love</p>

                <p>This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long<br>
                This is my story, this is my song<br>
                Praising my Savior all the day long</p>

                What seems each time I tell it<br>
                More wonderfully sweet<br>
                I love to tell the story<br>
                For some have never heard<br>
                The message of salvation<br>
                From God’s own holy Word</p>

                To hear it like the rest<br>
                And when, in scenes of glory<br>
                I sing the new, new song<br>
                ’Twill be the old, old story<br>
                That I have loved so long</p>

               to give honor to my name, says the Lord of hosts,
               then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings.
               Indeed, I have already cursed them,
               because you do not lay it to heart.</p>
               <p>3. Behold, I will rebuke your offspring,
               and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings,
               and you shall be taken away with it.</p>
