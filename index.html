                <p>I heard an old, old story<br>
                How a Savior came from glory<br>
                How He gave His life on Calvary<br>

                How He made the lame to walk again<br>
                And caused the blind to see<br>
                And then I cried, dear Jesus<br>

                And somehow Jesus came and brought<br>
                To me the victory</p>

                Beyond the crystal sea<br>
                About the angels singing<br>
                And the old redemption story<br>
                And some sweet day I'll sing up there<br>
                The song of victory</p>

                Because I know 'tis true<br>
                It satisfies my longings<br>
                As nothing else can do</p>
